Business Rules:

1. For each course, find the number of sections with more than 10 students.
2. For each gym, find if it is at full capacity.
3. For each team, find the number of competitions they have won.
4. For any two teams, find their soonest upcoming match.
5. Find the percentage of students who failed a course for a given semester.
6. Find the top 5 most used venues (venues with the most events) during a given month.
7. Find the most popular category of products in stock in all stores. 
8. For all courses, find the average number of classes all the sections have. 
              (for example, if a course has 3 sections with 3,2, and 1 weekly classes each, 
                the average number of weekly classes that course would be 2)
